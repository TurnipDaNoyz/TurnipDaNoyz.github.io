        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>Here's some rapid fire fun facts about me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I am half blind (my left eye is fine but my right eye is blind).</li>
            <li>I used to take choir and I currently study sound design.</li>
            <li>Double Major in College with majors in <b>Information Technology</b> and <b>Technical Theatre.</b></li>
            <li>Proud owner of a Steam Deck.</li>
            <li>Took piano for a few years, but would honestly rather pick up the accordion if I ever tried an instrument again.</li>
            <li>I've had 4 dogs over the years.</li>
            <li>Here's some random python code I wrote, I guess.</li>
        </ol>
        <code>
            radius = float(input("Enter the cone's radius: "))<br>
            height = float(input("Enter the cone's height: "))<br>
            volume = (radius ** 2) * 3.14 * (height/3)<br> 
            print("The resulting cone's volume is:",volume)
        </code>
