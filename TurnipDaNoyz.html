        <h2>Why the name TurnipDaNoyz?</h2>
        <p>Theres two reasons behind my name:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Because it relates to Sound Design, a hobby I ultimately want to pick up some day and-</li>
            <li>Because its what I made my Xbox gamertag on Christmas. Lol.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's stuck around ever since. I'm quite happy with it, and I think it's pretty funny.</p>
        <p>Another alias I went by back then was <b>Squeezy_Orange</b>, on Minecraft. Ultimately I got tired of it and wanted something else.</p>
        <p>Other than that, theres not much else to my name. The pun should be obvious, but I still get a chuckle everytime I hear someone say:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Oh, so <b>Turn up the Noise</b> is the joke behind your name."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Pretty happy with it. :D</p>
